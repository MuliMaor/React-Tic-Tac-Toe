Developed as part of my React self-learning.

Designed for 2 local players, this project features not only the basic mechanics of the game including automatic turn switching, victory and draw checks, but also editable player names and a log underneath the gameboard detailing the moves that have been made so far.

Many of the basic elements of React are used here, and care was taken to use efficient, optimized code and coding best practices.
